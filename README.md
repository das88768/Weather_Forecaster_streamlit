# Weather_Forcaster
A Weather forecast web app made with python and streamlit.
In this project I use the pyowm module to fetch the weather data from the Openweathermap using APIs.
This weather app show you the current weather info and next 5 days weather info.
I used 'matplotlib' a ploting library to show the 5 days minimum and maximum temperature and maximum humidity of next five days.
All the weather information is beautifully organized and shows you in very easy way.
Here I use streamlit library for frontend devlopment.
